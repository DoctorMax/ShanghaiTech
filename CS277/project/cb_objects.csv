From 1992 through 1998, Beaupre was spotlighted annually as one of the top high tech PR agencies in America. In 1999, Beaupre was acquired by Brodeur and Omnicom Group (NYSE: OMC), the most successful communications holding company in the world. This $10.5 billion corporation embraces a very selective M&A model and consistently leads the marketing business in every financial and operational measure.  Brodeur and Omnicom have made Beaupre a better company by broadening our relationships, services, knowledge and capabilities around the globe.

Here's the amazing part. Since being acquired, we've retained our entire management team, our brand, culture and our founding business model. We're proud of the fact that Beaupre people average nine years employment with our company; many have been with us much longer. We're equally proud of the success our clients have achieved, including more than 30 Beaupre clients acquired in major M&A deals exceeding $12 billion.

The two main aims of the site are:

* Creating definitive and independent gig listings
* Building a network of live music fans sharing their gig experiences

Definitive gig listings are achieved by pulling concert listings from all available sources in to one listing on GigJunkie. Through our own technology, and where necessary manual data entry, data is gathered from ticket agents (See, Ticketmaster, TicketWeb etc.), promoters (Live Nation, SJM, Metropolis etc.), major labels (EMI, Universal, Sony etc.) and other sources (local listings, MySpace, Facebook etc.). GigJunkie also lets users (fans/bands/promoters/venues) add gigs to the listings to promote them for free. This enables the live music fan to stay up to date on what's on.

The networking side of GigJunkie helps users build a profile of the bands they love and venues they often go to. GigJunkie can then automatically alert them by email and SMS as gigs are added so they don't miss out on anything. Users can buy tickets through GigJunkie at the same price as going direct to existing agents but without the hassle of searching all the different listing sites. Users can connect with fellow GigJunkies, invite each other to gigs, keep a diary of gigs they go to, post photos, write reviews and rate bands/venues etc. GigJunkie also gives users the chance to win loads of gig and festival tickets. GigJunkie's development is ongoing and there is lots more features coming to engage and entertain the users.

How it works: Your customers are asked to provide a testimonial and once given they are displayed on your own unique page at Testimonial Monkey.

You can also respond publicly to the customer comments, so the process is an interactive two way one.

This honest and open approach to customer feedback helps businesses to improve website conversion rates and boost company profits.  Reviews can also be shared with social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter helping businesses to build their online reputation and brand.

There are five separate plans, so there is something here for everyone. The cheapest plan works out at Â£29 per month, but this has limited functionality and services.

By doing so, users can listen to messages spread in different areas they have an interest in without being physically present. We do not consider ourselves to be part of social media as we know it, but more precisely of what we would name 'local media'.
